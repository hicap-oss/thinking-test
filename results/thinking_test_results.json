  "text_content": "# The Last Leaf\n\nOn a quiet street, an old painter named Marcus noticed his neighbor, a young girl named Lily, sitting alone on her porch every day, looking sad.\n\nOne autumn morning, he asked her what was wrong.\n\n\"See that tree?\" she pointed to an oak with falling leaves. \"When the last leaf falls, my mom says our time in this house ends. We have to move away.\"\n\nMarcus looked at the struggling tree, then at Lily's teary eyes.\n\nThat night, a storm hit. Wind howled and rain poured. By morning, every leaf had fallenâexcept one. A single, perfect leaf clung to the highest branch.\n\nDays passed. Wind blew, snow fell, but that one leaf never dropped.\n\nLily smiled again. Her mother found a new job nearby. They stayed.\n\nYears later, Lily discovered the truth: Marcus had climbed that tree in the storm and wired a copper leaf to the branchâpainted so perfectly it looked real.\n\nThe old painter had given her hope when she needed it most.\n\n**The End**\n\n---\n\nSometimes the magic we need comes from the kindness of others.",
