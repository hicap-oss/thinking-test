  "text_content": "# The Last Leaf\n\nOn a cold autumn morning, Maya found a tiny bird shivering on her doorstep. Its wing was bent at an odd angle.\n\nShe brought it inside, made a nest from an old shoebox, and carefully set the wing with popsicle sticks and tape. Every day, she fed it seeds and water with an eyedropper.\n\n\"You'll fly again,\" she whispered, though she wasn't sure it was true.\n\nWeeks passed. The leaves fell from the oak tree outside her windowâall except one stubborn red leaf that clung to the highest branch.\n\nOn the morning that last leaf finally fell, the bird hopped to the edge of its box. It stretched its wings, testing them. Maya opened the window.\n\nWith a flutter, it lifted into the air, circled her room once as if to say goodbye, and soared out into the bright winter sky.\n\nMaya smiled, watching until it disappeared. Sometimes the smallest acts of kindness have wings of their own.\n\n---\n\n*Hope you enjoyed it! Would you like another story, or something different?*",
